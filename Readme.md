# What is Twitter Sentiment Analysis?

Twitter sentiment analysis analyzes the sentiment or emotion of tweets. It uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets automatically as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. It can be done for individual tweets or a larger dataset related to a particular topic or event.
